- Fixed the picture squishing and stretching around the inventory, examination screens and menus. Fades now cover the whole 16:9 screen instead of just the 4:3 middle, and the items and Harry's portrait no longer appear squashed while the menu opens
- Fixed gameplay still showing in the side bars after warm resetting back to the title screen
- Fixed the rainbow block corruption in the Lisa cutscene reported by several users (let me know)
- Free camera reworked with mouse look and WASD, and it no longer drops you into an empty untextured world anywhere
- Fixed Grey Children lunging and grabbing far too early at high frame rates
- Fixed the idle look-around animation triggering after a couple of seconds instead of 10 to 15
- Fixed Monster Cybil throwing her attack two to four times per swing at high frame rates
- Fixed the multi-second freezes when opening and closing the quick menu
- Fixed the enemies-ignore-Harry cheat, which only worked on a handful of enemy types and expired on its own. It now works on every enemy
- Fixed god mode and enemies-ignore-Harry doing nothing at all unless debug controls were enabled
- Fixed a performance problem that could stall the game for several seconds at a time, most noticeably when standing against a wall
- Added a widescreen camera fix for the return to the alley, turning the shot away from the empty space past the wall (I can fix others too, please report)
- Added optional low-health red glow, and a PC Options HUD page
- Added an 8192x8192 flashlight shadow map option
- Added Ctrl+F5 fast forward, plus wireframe (Ctrl+F1) and no-textures (Ctrl+F2), all can be toggled in the quick menu
- Removed the bare F5 and F6 keys, which could potentially chang PGXP rendering settings with no way to tell what had happened. All the renderer debug keys now need Ctrl held
- Fixed the minimap snapping to a different spot after closing the inventory
- Flashlight shadows now stay on while the game is paused
- Fixed picked-up items sitting slightly low in widescreen
- Fixed the cutscene squish that crept back in
- Fixed quick heal still working with no healing items
- Fixed jump-back ending in mid-air instead of landing
- Fixed Polish glyphs folding together after switching language in-game
- The PSX Screen Position option is now pinned to its default, since the port has its own framing controls
- README and documentation refreshed for the multi-platform beta

- Fixed upscaled FMVs not working
- Fixed issue preventing Mac/Linux from compiling

Commit summaries:

## beta-2026.08.21.2 -- 2026-08-21
- Fixed filtering past bilinear not staying applied properly
- Finally fixed long time mesh and geometry corruption issue that would cause missing elevator doors, rainbow artifacts, and more. If you still see any of this please report it. It mainly happened in Nowhere / Nightmare School.
- Fixed Harry ghosting on load screen
- Fixed Harry not being out of breath after running in alternate camera modes
- Fixed item pickups so they are in the right spot vertically
- Added additional support to launcher for DLL mods that edit the game's source code. It's limited to the map DLL files currently (in maps), and it will make sure they have signatures and data matching a DLL file with game code for extra security. Additional config options or console commands should be supported. It will also give a general warning about loading DLLs, and present anything that could be unusual. Please use these kinds of mods at your own risk. Will add more support if it ends up being neeeded.

Commit summaries:
- fix: texture filter modes above bilinear reset to bilinear every boot
- fix: Harry never got tired after sprinting in the alternate cameras

- diag: [RESTAMP] reports the base slot's native CLUT origin
- diag: [RESTAMP] caps per material, not globally
- diag: [RESTAMP-WILD] -- past-pool stamps get their own log budget
- diag: reformat forensics -- [IPDREF]/[IPDREF-DR] + pointer identities in [WOBJ-POISON]
- fix: Nowhere corruption root -- stale world-object models survived chunk reloads
- fix: item pickups framed low under a non-zero vshift
- mod manager: DLL mod support with static screening, deploy whitelist, and install consent (PR #104, reworked)
- dll security: edited-game-code fingerprint enforcement + install-time import naming
- dll security: proper '\0' escapes (heredoc had embedded raw NULs); 43/43 shipped DLLs pass the strict audit
- mod manager: post-extraction DLL screening + auto-arm enable_plugins on applied plugin mods
- cut the runtime plugin channel entirely
- mod registry: let map DLLs add console commands and read their own config keys
- dll security: derive the allowlist from the game exe's own imports (fix old-build false positives)
- launcher: game runtime libs in the static baseline (fix false positives when the exe isn't beside the launcher)

- diag: [BLOODCLUT] dump the palette the spray multiplies
- fix: unfaded blood clone layers; decals fade toward fog, not black
- diag: [BLOOD4] dump all four spray layers as emitted
- fix: white spray edges (glow imbalance); decals skip when fully fogged

- diag: [MMDRAW] -- the intro carries paperIdx=1 and passes every gate
- Minimap: place intro street (map0_s00) via map2_s00's Old Town case
- sfxmod: replacements play at their authored rate for low-rate bank samples too
- strip session diagnostics: [MMGATE]/[MMDRAW]/[MMDIAG]/[BLOOD4]/[BLOODDIAG]/[BLOODCLUT]/[FXDIAG]

## beta-2026.08.20.1 -- 2026-08-20
- Fixed N appearing in Japanese inventory descriptions
- Blood partially fixed and affected by fog (still need to do blood puddles)
- Borderless: Now stretches chosen resolution to your desktop resolution instead of just running at your desktop resolution. The resolution setting is now effectively the rendering resolution as well. 
- Pillarboxing: Selecting YES for pillarboxing will now cause 4:3 resolutions stretched to desktop size to have the correct aspect ratio and pillarboxing. For example, if you select a 4:3 resolution and set borderless/fullscreen with a 16:9 desktop, with pillarboxing YES the game will take up your whole screen but have black bars, OFF will strech
Note: Menus only should still be the default when playing with a widescreen (16:9+) resolution! This will prevent menus from stretching but allow the world to render natively widescreen.
- 320x240 has been added as a resolution option, works best Windowed/Borderless

Still trying to fix bilinear, will get it in with more bug fixes next update.

Commit summaries:
- fix: Japanese item-description N, for real this time; PSX-native resolutions
- psycross: bilinear via the real 3D marker; borderless internal resolution (unfixed)

- Fixed issue where sound replacements were not working with MAP banks (level sounds)
- Fixed issue with flashlight during hospital bottle liquid scene
- Nowhere: Reports of corruption issues coming back but it is hardware specific. Please share your log if you ecounter this. New logging has been added to help identify the issue.

- Sound replacements play at whatever sample rate your wav is, no need to match the original anymore (big deal for the low rate MAP sounds)
- Sound replacements also accept the filename the Audio tool exports, so MAP000_005.wav works as well as MAP000.005.wav
- Fixed rock drill smoke and chainsaw sound carrying on after using the quick weapon switch key
- Main menu, options, map screens and puzzles run at your FPS setting instead of being locked to 60, inventory and cutscenes stay at 60 (set menu_fps_unlock = 0 in config.cfg to put it back)

- inventory: carve the screen gameStates out of the alt-camera stand-down

## beta-2026.08.08.1 -- 2026-08-08
- Door transitions now properly fade to black. Loading is  also much faster.
- Examining things now pauses the game the way it does on PSX. Before this only memos and
  item pickups froze the world.
- New Fog Strength slider in the in-game options (PC Options) so that it doesn't need the console.
- Added a draw distance setting to go with it — `draw_distance_pct` in config.cfg, 100 is
  vanilla and 200 roughly doubles how far you can see. Lower the fog and raise this
  together, either one on its own won't do much. At higher settings
  distant buildings can occasionally sort in front of each other.
- Play as: nine more characters, 14 total. Each one uses its own body proportions now
  instead of being stretched onto Harry's skeleton, characters with extra bones sit
  correctly, and the female characters have an optional voice pitch shift (sound effects
  only, on by default). 
- Item models can be replaced with modern glTF models now — full colour, no PSX vertex
  limits. A texture embedded in the model takes priority over a texture pack, slightly
  out-of-range UVs get clamped instead of the model being rejected, and the size limit
  comes from the file itself. Also fixed the models rendering
  see-through on the pickup and take screens.
- Mod Manager: TMD <-> OBJ converters added, so item models can be edited in Blender and
  converted back. Added a TMD replace path that works out the correct texture bank itself
  instead of asking you. Fixed character OBJ exports coming out with wrong UV scaling —
  they were being scaled to a fixed 256x256 instead of the character's own texture.
- Texture packs: the VRAM limit is worked out from your actual GPU now, textures you
  haven't used get evicted instead of the budget filling up, and zip readers are cached.
  Fixed a bug where the budget could deadlock and leave you stuck on native textures for
  the rest of the session.
- Fixed monsters grabbing you in a map that doesn't have their reaction animations and
  freezing you in place permanently — mostly hit when spawning monsters into maps they
  don't belong in. Also fixed the Romper pin dropping you through the floor.
- Fixed the alt cameras (FPS/TPS/OTS) dropping back to the classic camera whenever you
  opened a menu or examined something.
- Fixed the minimap running off the edge of the screen when pillarboxed.
- Preload Chunks moved out of the in-game options since it needs a map reload anyway and
  the launcher still has it; Disable Culling took its place.
- Launcher no longer overwrites settings in config.cfg that it doesn't own. It was
  reverting things like resident_textures and deleting keys you'd added by hand.
- Launcher will warn you if resident_textures is set to 0, which can cause graphical glitches (like rainbow bars in a couple of cutscenes) and is recommended to be 1 unless you have issues with it on.

Commit summaries:
- clear: only use the fog color on a frame that actually drew the world
- alt cameras: stop standing down for menus and examines

- playas: optional voice-pitch shift for the female characters (SFX only)
- playas: default the female voice pitch on
- playas: lift the female voice further, but not the breathing with it
- playas: raise the female voiced pitch to 140, hold breath at 118
- Bump PsyCross: arm/lapse logging for the cutscene rainbow bar
- texpack: report live pack GL bytes against the budget in the cache stats line
- launcher: TMD <-> OBJ converters — item models are editable
- launcher: TMD replace path + derive the page-14 bank instead of asking
- launcher: stop clobbering config.cfg settings the launcher does not own
- launcher: warn at Play when resident_textures is off
- playas: stop an oversized skin TIM overrunning the chara CLUT shelf
- docs: record the PsyCross PR triage (5 PRs: 3 adapted, 2 closed)
- items: modern glTF item models (adapted from PR #97 + PsyCross PR #16)
- docs: record the completed glTF adaptation
- docs: correct the glTF item scope -- it already covers the bank TMDs
- items: an embedded glTF texture now outranks a pack override
- items: tolerate and clamp small UV overhang instead of rejecting the model
- items: run the UV-area test on authored UVs, not clamped ones
- items: derive the glTF geometry cap from the buffer, not a guessed 8192
- items: report the glTF texture source per surface, not once per item
- ILM->OBJ: scale UVs by the character's own TIM, not a fixed 256x256

- docs: record the puppet nurse/doctor triple-face fix
- texpack: stop the pack budget deadlocking into permanent native art
- combat: don't enter a grab the current map has no reaction anims for
- docs: record the foreign-monster grab freeze and its guard
- combat: guard the Romper pin too, and stop it dropping you through the floor
- fix: freeze the world for every examine, and stop doors cutting to black
- console: FBDAMP tunes the framebuffer-feedback gain live
- fix: fade doors to black BEFORE the blocking load, not during it
- perf: drain blocking loads at disk speed, not one sector per vblank
- transitions: halve the door out-fade, make it tunable, add a timing probe
- transitions: halve the load-screen minimum hold (60 -> 30 frames)
- options: draw-distance scale + Fog Strength row (replaces Disable Culling)
- options: swap Preload_Chunks for Disable_Culling on the System page
- options: correct the Fog_Strength comment — Disable_Culling is back on the page

## beta-2026.08.05.1 -- 2026-08-05
- Fix flickering when opening map or pausing, and also reduced time to open map.
- Allow hopping backwards when sprint + back is pushed in tps and ots camera modes

Commit summaries:
- pause/map: kill the grey flash on exit, and stop the map open crawling
- backstep: allow the sprint+back hop on TPS/OTS, gated on the run control
- backstep: restore the landing double-step sound on TPS/OTS

## beta-2026.08.04.1 -- 2026-08-04
- Texture packs: the stutter while walking around with a pack installed should be
  largely gone. The game was rebuilding HD textures in bulk in the middle of a frame —
  a doorway could cost over a second in one frame. It now builds them a few at a time,
  only for what is actually on screen, spread across frames.
- Texture packs: much lower VRAM. The game was building every colour variant of each
  texture (about 9) when only 2-3 are ever used, and the memory limit was a fixed 6 GB
  regardless of your card. It now builds only what is drawn and scales the limit to the
  VRAM your GPU reports, which should stop issues on cards under 12 GB.
  NOTE: There may be pop-in, please let me know if it is severe. Converting to DDS is advised if you haven't already.
- Borderless: the mouse no longer wanders onto your other monitor while you are picking
  up items, in the inventory or in menus. Alt+Tab and the Windows key still get you out.
  Set `confine_cursor = 0` in config.cfg for the old behaviour.
- Fixed a texture-pack bug where a slot could end up rendering a mix of two different
  textures.
- Quick save is now blocked during a boss fight (Split Head, Twinfeeler, Floatstinger,
  Bloodsucker, Cybil, Incubus/Incubator).
- Added playas console command that allows you to change characters between Lisa, Cybil, Kaufmann or Dahlia. Persists in config. Has some issues with some characters that will be fixed later (mainly just odd proportions). Can also toggle in while in the animation viewer mode (press k, then - and = with debug controls enabled)
- Mod manager has been updated with an improved model viewer that can now view every model type in the game, as well as convert them. Improved OBJ > ILM automatic conversion and character replacements are much more doable. The game supports larger TMDs as well now so those can be replaced more easily too.
- Fixed some issues that caused corruption in tree billboards or other aspects of the game in a long session after certain points in the game.

Commit summaries:
- playas: play as Lisa, Cybil, Kaufmann or Dahlia — character swap groundwork
- main_pc: replace a literal NUL byte with the '\0' escape
- big TMD: oversized loose item models for UNQ close-ups and IT packs
- launcher: Model Viewer 2.0 — props, TMDs, ANM playback, editable ANM JSON
- converters: seam lint, atlas gutters, and eight review fixes
- v7 welds: cross-part joints for high-poly models — the CJ seam root fix
- launcher: one reusable Model Viewer window + per-material texture atlas
- launcher: surface the weld count in the high-poly success dialog
- Fix EUR tree billboards turning to garbage squares after TV room
- launcher: put the Model Viewer button back where it can be seen
- launcher: size the Mod Manager tool column to its labels, not to 78px
- docs: record the EUR BG_ETC/TV2 stomp diagnosis
- borderless: keep the pointer inside the window while the game has focus
- texpack: size the VRAM budget to the GPU, and fix three budget/slot defects
- texpack: compose pack rows on demand instead of eagerly during the load
- quicksave: refuse to quick save while a boss is alive

## beta-2026.08.02.1 -- 2026-08-02
- Fixed bug that could cause inventory to be replaced when going through a door after a weapon was unequipped.
- Fixed bugs that could cause PAL to freeze at certain parts of the game.

Commit summaries:
- PAL documents: render ten lines like retail, and page instead of locking
- PAL documents: carry the ~C colour and ~M/~T alignment across a page break
- PAL documents: correct the line count and alignment origin of a broken page
- docs: index the PAL document line-cap soft-lock fix
- inventory: stop the starting-loadout block from eating live inventories


## beta-2026.07.31.2 -- 2026-07-31
- Fixed issue with pink menu text caused by controller settings menu fix.

Commit summary:
- fix pink menu text: queue FONT8NOC before FONT16, not after


## beta-2026.07.31.1 -- 2026-07-31
- Attract videos enabled! These are the videos that play if you sit AFK at the main menu. They may desync but they work. Set attract_demos = 0 in your config to disable them.
- Skip intros added back to launcher (by popular demand), replaces "Disable Culling" which can still be adjusted ingame or via the config.
- Skip intros can also be set to go straight to the game. Thanks to keylimesoda for the PR this came from (#84).
- The controller configuration screen works again, kind of. For now, TYPE 1 is USER and shows what you actually have bound in the launcher. Will figure out what to do with the others. One will probably be used to show alternate controls.
- Fixed chunks of character models disappearing
- Fixed the community center TV screens sliding around on their own if you were using any camera other than the default
- Fixed the achievement popup showing up as a black box. It would only look right in some casese if you happened to be aiming.
- Fixed cancelling out of the quick load screen dumping you back at the main menu, which also left half the menu as garbage and made OPTION play a random sound effect
- Fixed Harry standing in the fire in the hospital instead of backing away from it before he kneels
- Fixed walking and running distance not being counted on the results screen unless you were on the classic camera
- 2D controls were quietly making Harry run 25-40% slower than he should. Fixed, he runs at the proper speed now.
- Flashlight lens flare was going full brightness across almost the entire range instead of only when the light turns toward the camera. It ramps smoothly now.
- Minimap position setting no longer runs off the edge of the screen (Top L, Top R, Bottom L, Bottom R)
Note: A few of these are untested, like the fire scene. Let me know if any of them are still wrong.

Commit summaries:
- bones: keep hide-list terminators in the same object as the list
- Alt cameras: apply before the map hook; toast: pin the blend equation
- docs: index the alt-camera ordering + toast blend-equation fixes
- launcher: swap the Disable Culling option for Skip Intros

- saveload: back out of the load screen to wherever it was opened from
- 2D control: run at the authored speed; cutscenes: stop overriding the heading
- controls screen: restore the labels, rename TYPE 1 to USER, report the binds

- flare: drop the stale facing-knee compensation
- launcher: nudge the Skip Intros row into alignment


## beta-2026.07.30.1 -- 2026-07-30
- Fixed gray void in door transitions
- Fixed see-through item faces for items the player can pick up
- Minimap no longer shows areas where you don't have a map, config option "minimap_require_map" can be set to 0 for old behavior
- Added givemap command to give current map for the area you're in
- Made blue minimap markers red
- Added minimap size setting (60-120%)
- Minimap player arrow now scales with the minimap size instead of staying the same size
- Minimap option now controls shape as well, so Minimap = Off, Square, Circle. (Apologies, you may have to set your shape again if it's wrong)
- Fixed menus being blurry or having artifacts with HD texture packs even with menu filtering turned off
- Potential fixes for permanent rainbow texture corruption, this time on every kind of surface instead of just one
- Texture pack log now tells you which palette rows a pack didn't replace, so mixed HD/original models are easier to track down
Note: If you're on an AMD gpu and want to test the corruption fix, search your config for resident_textures and remove the line if it exists.

Commit summaries:
- Fix Linux build: RTLD_DEFAULT needs _GNU_SOURCE
- minimap: red markings, and fold shape into Minimap to free a row for scale
- minimap: only show the map once it has been found
- minimap: scale range 60-120%

## v2026.06.24.2 -- 2026-06-24
- Launcher is fixed to detect releases from new branches automatically now. 
- Enemies audited and a lot of issues are fixed. Enemies falling through floor should be fixed.

## beta-2026.06.24.1 -- 2026-06-24
- Controls: Revamped control system so that the default camera and control style have their own, separated control scheme from the alternate control styles. Now in the launcher, under controls, you can check a checkbox to switch the control scheme you are customizing the controls for. By default, they control similarly to modern action games.
- Pulled in more fixes from sergiomanzur to syncronize cutscene voices, fix cutscene stretching, improve fog, make intro screens skippable, misc cleanup, and combat improvements (apply enemy melee damage once per swing, before you could take more damage at high fps)
- Fog level slightly increased to match real SH, but can be tuned with fogstr console command
- Fixed console ghosting and black sky when game paused in most cases
- Fixed air screamer first appearance so it actually flaps its wings
- Fixed Hyper Blaster so it can be used from cheats
- Miscellaneous qol fixes detailed below
Coming soon: Fixing the black bar on top of certain fixed camera shots, issues with puzzle overlays in some cases, leftover random crashes, issue with katana damage + continuing to work on other known issues. Please report any crashes to me and it is certainly possible I forget things so feel free to remind me (especially if it's game breaking). Want to try fully implementing PAL + other language support soon as that has been requested a lot.

Commit summaries:

- Air Screamer flyby wings: flap in the AS update, not the event (AI was clobbering it)
- 2D-background clear: black bars for map-pickup; keep fog sky on the death screen
- 2D-bg clear: GAME OVER stays black; "no map"/"too dark" messages keep the foggy sky
- Fix console ghosting on pause + warning fading back in

## v2026.06.23.1 -- 2026-06-23
- BIG UPDATE! Sorry for the delay on this one, but wanted to get this new launcher out so that I wouldn't be so hesitant to push updates in the future. I will make a video going over this update as well, but I will list the big change below, and all the Claude commit summaries are below that.
- PGXP: Seams/Missing faces FIXED, warping almost fixed and is barely noticeable now. PGXP is near perfect!
- Collision into Invisible Walls: FIXED!! None so far after extensive testing!
- Launcher: Added build settings to choose a custom build from any point (will not overwrite the launcher). After choosing a custom build, click apply and then download build! This will be useful if I ever break things in an update and you need to revert to an old Version
- Launcher: Also added ability to use a custom repo. Meaning if anyone forks and mods my port, you can load their version directly through the launcher! They just have to post releases in their fork in a way the launcher will recognize (more on that soon)
- Launcher: Controls section, added mouse bindings and EXPERIMENTAL Thirdperson\Over the shoulder camera options! Be sure to bind the keys appropriately for these modes, and with it enabled you can press F9 or the right stick to cycle camera modes.
- Thirdperson/Over the Shoulder: Use right stick or mouse to look, left stick\WASD (optional) to move. Strafing is enabled in this mode as well.
- OTS Camera: By default press middle mouse to swap shoulders!
- TPS/OTS: You can turn on a crosshair, or invert the mouse/right stick
- Steam Deck: Merged fix from PR from sergiomanzur that may fix Steam Deck graphics. If not there is also more logging available to help. Please post in the github issue if you're still seeing issues!
- Crashing\Visual glitches: Lots should be fixed, let me know what remains! Please comment on the comprehensive issue list in GitHub
- Console: Now has history via up/down and will not glitch while the game is paused. Should be doc available for setflags console command usage for triggering cutscenes manually, if not will make it soon.

Coming soon: Inventory item backface visibility issue fix. Other visual bug and crash fixes.

- PGXP: FIXED!! From testing, PGXP has been greatly improved. There are still ocassional seams or missing faces, but much better than before.
Coming soon: Aspect ratio fixes (no more wide harry) + things already mentioned

## v2026.06.19.1 -- 2026-06-19

- Crash Fixes: The Church cutscene crash and similar crash points should be fixed. Late game boat door crash *might* be fixed but needs testing. If not it will be tonight.
- Console: You can now type ., -/_, and =/+ (Shift-aware) — so commands like weld 2.5 and inveqy -50 work.
- Console: tays open after a command now (run several in a row); press Enter on an empty line, or ~, to close it.
- Controls: Esc now always works (no debug mode needed): warm-resets to the title in-game, and quits the game at the title screen.
- Controls: F1 (PGXP toggle) now always works without debug controls.
- Debug: Crashes now write a full call-stack; crash reports are self-diagnosing.

## v2026.06.18.6 -- 2026-06-18

## v2026.06.18.1 -- 2026-06-18

## v2026.06.16.3 -- 2026-06-16

---New debug console commands

Open the console with ~ (tap to toggle, hold to type a command, debug controls must be enabled in launcher).

- give <item> — grant weapons, ammo, recovery, and story/ending items. Run help give and help give 2 for the full list. Firearms come with ammo; give allweapons grants everything. Examples: give shotgun, give flauros, give aglaophotis.
- getflags — show the event flags that determine the ending and their current state.
- setending bad | bad+ | good | good+ — set the two flags that select the SH1 ending (Cybil saved + the Kaufmann/good path) in one go. Set it before reaching the ending.
- setflag <n> 0|1 — set any event flag (0–1663) directly.
- clearflags — forget console-set flags so they stop carrying into the next New Game / map load.

Flags set via the console persist through a New Game boot, so you can choose an ending in the menu, set it, then start a New Game into the ending map to test it without a save.

- PGXP: bump PsyCross — persist shared-vertex parks, strip diagnostics
- console: expand give (story items), add getflags/setflag for ending testing
- console: add setending bad|bad+|good|good+
- console: persist console-set flags across map warp

---

## v2026.05.16.1 — Initial release snapshot

First public nightly. Snapshot of the PC port's state as of the launcher's
auto-update rollout.

### Boot & menus
- Konami / KCET logos, intro FMV, main menu, options screen, save/load
  screens all navigable.
- Loading screen plays correctly between map transitions.
- Pre-Konami "graphic content" warning screen wired up.
- 15-second startup delay (audio task pool drain) eliminated.

### World rendering
- Full 3D world + textured environments with fog.
- Per-vertex shader fog replacing the original PSX overlay system; fixes
  the seam line on top of the screen.
- 16:9 hor+ widescreen with per-shot pixel-aspect culling correction.

### Player
- Harry's full body renders with all 23 bones and gouraud shading.
- Movement: walk + run via collision-based path. Wall collision and
  floor height fully working in most areas.
- TPS (third-person) follow-cam toggle on numpad `2`. WIP
- Aim + fire system: handgun and knife work; muzzle flash and blood
  splat re-enabled safely.

### Combat & enemies
- Air Screamer (bird enemy): AI, animation, swoop attack, hit-take,
  death-and-fade all working. Cafe-window break cutscene plays.
- Groaner (dog): full AI from disc-extracted rodata.
- Bloodsucker, Romper, SplitHead, Creeper, HangedScratcher, LarvalStalker,
  PuppetNurse: AI re-enabled via per-enemy `*_anim_infos.c` + per-DLL
  dispatch tables extracted from disc.
- Cybil, Alessa (and her ghost-child variant), BloodyLisa, Lisa,
  Kaufmann, Dahlia: NPC AI enabled (anim infos extracted).
- Enemy spawn density restored to vanilla PSX: fixed a 16-byte
  `s_SpawnInfo` struct mismatch on x86-64 that was making every distance
  check use a bogus Z coordinate, and reduced the per-slot spawn
  cooldown from 10s to 1s.

### Audio
- SFX via PsyCross SPU → OpenAL.
- Ambient SFX VAB loads properly.
- BGM loads correctly.
- XA voice streaming from the original disc image.
- 3D audio: distance-based volume falloff restored (was previously
  full-volume regardless of distance — Air Screamer wing flap could be
  heard across the entire map).

### Cameras
- WYSIWYG `s_camCorrections[]` system with road-region matching and
  per-anchor XZ-radius override.
- Hand-tuned corrections across map0_s00 intro (3 starting-area shots,
  Cheryl-chase alley, alley2 first/second/third/fourth fixed cams,
  alley3 shots through final post-spawn), map0_s01 cafe entry, and
  map2_s00 post-cafe dog-head area.
- Rotation deltas (yaw/pitch) now stored as rotation rather than baked
  into translation — survives baseline drift on tracking cams.
- Camera correction system skipped during cutscenes (when
  `VC_USER_CAM_F` is set) so DMS-driven cinematic cams aren't perturbed.

### Cutscenes & FMVs
- DMS-driven in-game cutscenes work (opening, cafe, etc.).
- FMV playback via ported DuckStation MDEC + custom STR demuxer +
  MPEG-1 VLC decoder. XA audio mixed in.
- Enter-key input bleed from FMV skip into the next state fixed.

### Map system
- 42/42 maps compile successfully.
- PSX-address sanitizer scrubs raw `0x80XXXXXX` function pointers from
  DLL map headers.

### Debug / launcher
- Top-row `4`/`5` keys log BAD/GOOD camera positions with full delta
  capture (post-rotation translation + raw yaw/pitch nudges).
- Numpad `.` logs Harry's detailed position + camera state for tracking
  fall-through-floor spots.
- Numpad `3` rescue-teleport + collision probe.
- Launcher with display config, debug logging toggle, hi-res loose
  texture toggle, map override, fullscreen / vsync / culling / preload
  / intro / PGXP settings, dropdown for UI scaling.

### Known issues at v2026.05.16.1
- Some areas show garbage / chunky-pixel textures on walls.
- Map item screens have rendering issues (item TMD invisible during pickups).
- Falling-through-floor in certain spots (under active diagnosis).
- Handgun bullets pickup model invisible (under active diagnosis).
