 * adds the draw buffer's VRAM origin, so console's OFY is 112 plus wherever
 * the back buffer sits; the +8 here compensates for how PsyCross carries that
 * origin instead, validated on screen (and re-validated after the GsIDMATRIX2
 * fix). The knobs (vshift/cutshift) are deltas ON TOP of the anchor.
 *
 * One implementation, two consumers:
 *  - Gfx_InGameDraw asserts this at the MOMENT the world is projected. The
 *    end-of-frame assert in MainLoop lands one frame late by construction
 *    (the state update projects everything before it runs), and any 0<->8
 *    transition leaked one world frame at the stale value -- the 8-row upward
 *    flick on every common-pickup confirm.
 *  - MainLoop's assert still runs every frame as the baseline every OTHER
 *    projection inherits (the pickup item pass, menus, item screens), with
 *    the take-screen zero exemption applied there and only there.
 *
 * Branch semantics (moved verbatim from the old in-loop block):
 *  - Gameplay, no pickup: cutscenes take base+cutshift; every gameplay camera
 *    takes base+vshift (one offset for ALL camera types -- the fixed/chase
 *    split made framing jump between camera types); the result is HELD.
 *  - Any other InGame state renders the world too (examine, door, inventory,
 *    pause) and must not jump, so it returns the held value -- EXCEPT during
 *    a cutscene/letterbox, which owns its framing (the alley-match-scene bars
 *    fault, 161b950d4): those take base+cutshift so the world stays under the
 *    2D bars.
 *  - Outside InGame, the clean baseline. */
